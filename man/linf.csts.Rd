\title{Truncated L-infinity CSTs (label-aware)}
\usage{
linf.csts(S, n0 = 50)
}
\arguments{
\item{S}{Numeric matrix (samples x features), typically L∞-relatives.}

\item{n0}{Integer >= 1. Minimum size for a cell to be kept.}
}
\value{
list with:
\itemize{
\item cell.index     : integer vector (final truncated indices)
\item cell.label     : character vector (final truncated labels)
\item kept.cells.idx : integer vector of kept feature indices
\item kept.cells.lbl : character vector of kept feature labels
\item raw.index      : integer vector (pre-truncation)
\item raw.label      : character vector (pre-truncation)
\item size.table     : table of original cell sizes (by label, desc)
}
}
\description{
Keep L∞ cells with at least n0 samples (by label); reassign samples from small
cells to argmax restricted to the kept set. Returns both indices and labels.
}
